## GenProgJS: a Baseline System for Test-based Automated Repair of JavaScript Programs 
GenProgJS was evaluated on the [BugsJS dataset](https://bugsjs.github.io). The random nature of the genetic algorithm makes it harder to validate and reproduce our results, thus, for the sake of generalization our experiments were carried out on 5 independent runs. On this page we gathered and systematized the data for all the generated patches and display them.
